3D-SuperGraphics_and_RayTracing

This repository contains (in the folder "Files_At_The_End_Of_Each_Chapter") the files and further material created and used in my udemy course about 3D-supergraphics and RayTracing:
https://www.udemy.com/course/3d-supergrafik-und-raytracing-in-deinem-browser/?referralCode=DF539CD573622AB2FE44

Additionally, the latest DRAFT version of my sporadically updated 3D-RayTracing program can be found here. To use it, just download all files, which
   are NOT in the folder called "Files_At_The_End_Of_Each_Chapter" and save them all into one folder on your computer. 
   Then just open the file "3D_SuperGraphics.html" in your browser by double-clicking it.

Feedback is very welcome every time.
 
Note: I know there is still a lot to improve... that is why I call it a "draft version". Please do not get upset if things do not yet work as expected :-)
